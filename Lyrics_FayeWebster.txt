The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time
I don't know that much about Kingston
But I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain
I think that tonight I'll leave my light on
'Cause I get lonely when it's out and I miss you right about now

[Chorus]
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more

[Verse 2]
He said baby, that's what he called me, I love you
Every single word you say makes me feel some type of way
It's the thought of you that slightly scares me
But it takes my breath away, forget what I was gonna say
The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time
[Chorus]
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more[Verse 1]
You said you can't change your haircut
But it looks good anyway
I kinda wonder where you got it
And I doubt you even paid

[Chorus]
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you

[Verse 2]
I wonder if you got home
But we just said goodbye
You looked back at me once
But I looked back two times
[Chorus]
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you

[Outro]
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you

I didn't know that I was capable of being happy right now
But you showed me how
I didn't know that you were right in front of me
Until I looked out

[Chorus]
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way

You weigh just as much as me, don't you (ah)
I can feel it when we touch
I know you've been having nightmares lately
And I'm sorry I fall asleep first

You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way

I'm losing my mind
Why the hell did I paint these walls white?
And I wonder, what's the point of this life?
Sometimes I'll pray but I will never close my eyes

[Verse 2]
I want to be happy
Find a man with an old name just like me
And get over how my dog is my best friend
And he doesn't even know what my name is

[Chorus]
Jonny, did you ever love me?
Jonny, help me figure it out
Not that I've paid attention
But you haven't said it out loud
Jonny, do you see what you're doing?
What you're making me think about?
This wasn't 'posed to be a love song
But I guess it is now
[Bridge]
Jonny, maybe you'll never hear this
Or maybe it's stuck in your head
Well, I hope it makes you cry
The way that I did

[Chorus]
Jonny, did you ever love me?
Jonny, help me figure it out
Not that I've paid attention
But you haven't said it out loud
Jonny, do you see what you're doing?
What you're making me think about?
This wasn't 'posed to be a love song
But I guess it is now, isn't it?
Let's sit around and drink some saké
Then we can argue 'bout the same things
Talk about neighbors on our front porch
I wonder if they know we're moving
Hope they don't know my landlord personally
'Cause I never told him you moved in with me
But fuck him, he kept my money

[Verse 2]
I think your sisters are so pretty
Got drunk and they forgot they met me
I made her laugh one time at dinner
She said I'm funny and then I thanked her
But I know I'm funny haha
[Verse 3]
We go through phases when we're over ours
Right now we both wanna be rockstars
Got you a bass last year on your birthday
The same one the guy from Linkin Park plays
But you look better with it anyways3Embed Hurts Me Too Lyrics[Verse 1]
My mother told me one day
She's tired of my sad songs
But loving you has only
Made me cry twice or so
The day that I said I loved you
You didn't say it in return
That was the day I realized
That silence is actually hurt

[Chorus]
And I am done changing words
Just so my songs sound prettier
I just don't care if it hurts
'Cause it hurts me too
[Verse 2]
I hate that feeling at night
When I thought my eyes were closed
But they were open the whole time
It was just too dark to know
And what am I 'posed to do when
My dad cries in front of me?
Do I just close my eyes and
Pretend like I didn't see?

[Chorus]
And I am done changing words
Just so my songs sound prettier
I just don't care if it hurts
'Cause it hurts me too4Embed Better Distractions Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sit around until I find something better to spend my time
But nothing's appealin'
Nothing really lasts that long for me to realize, I'm still alone
And you're not with me
I wonder what's inside your mind, but you seem pretty occupied
So I'll leave it alone
If only I could do the same, share your ways, and I'll change the name
And make it my own

[Chorus]
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
[Verse 2]
I tried to eat, I tried to sleep, but everything seems boring to me
I don't know what to do
Got two friends that I could see, but they got two jobs and a baby
I just wanna see you
Dependin' on our time apart, thе better the distractions arе
And there isn't a lot
Only took a couple times without you here to realize
But I figured it out

[Chorus]
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?

I think I have lost so much time
Over the course of calling you mine
You say it's fine
But she won't go away

[Verse 2]
So maybe next year
Things will go just as I planned
Maybe, who knows, she could be down
But she won't go away

[Chorus]
It's you, hiding in limelight
It's you, no one really likes
It's you, happy all the time
It's you
[Verse 3]
How do I forget that she's around?
Is there a trick?
Middle ground, be okay with it
'Cause she won't go away

I saw you last night in my dream
That's still the closest you and I have been
That's kind of sad, don't you think?
I think so

[Chorus]
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
I don't know
I don't know

How am I supposed to ever be with him
When he and I don't speak the same language?
But we have conversations in my head

How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
I don't know

My grandmother's dead
And I can't sleep 'cause this isn't my bed
He doesn't even know those things exist

[Chorus]
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
I don't know

Or I'll just keep wearing his name on my shirt
Whatever I need just to help me cope

Looks like I've been crying again over the same thing
I wonder if anyone has ever cried for me
Nothing means anything, at least anymore
Even my tears have gone room temperature

[Chorus]
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more

[Verse 2]
I was sitting here last year, the same time ago
Still wearing the same thing, these aren't even my clothes
I just don't change that much 'cause who's to impress?
There's nobody around when I'm at my best

I should get out more, I should get out more

I should get out more, I should get out more

Alone again
I could see somebody coming a mile in
I've lost so much more than I'll admit
So I'm just sitting here alone again

[Verse 2]
Alone again
Maybe I'll visit my dad this weekend
We haven't been that close since you stepped in
But now I've got so much time alone again

[Verse 3]
Alone again
My mind's empty as the room I'm sleeping in
I covered my window, now my plants are dead
So they know how I feel, alone again
[Verse 4]
Alone again
I'm tying my shoes for the fun of it
I'm talking to my dog, just crying
But the more I speak the more I feel alone again

[Outro]
What am I doing alone again?
How could you leave me alone again?
Alone again
Alone again1Embed Cheers Lyrics[Verse 1]
You came here to welcome me
To what is the end
You said if we weren't in love
We'd still be best friends
We both tell the same jokes
Over and over
Wonder if we'll get married
Before my brother

[Chorus]
And let's cheers to you
And let's cheers to me

I like your songs even though
They're not about me
Sometimes I'm scared to show my dad

And let's cheers to you
And let's cheers to me
And let's cheers to you
And let's cheers to me

[Instrumental]1Embed Jonny (Reprise) Lyrics[Verse]
Jonny, who was it that said
"A white wall may seem empty
But it's ready to be filled
And, in its readiness, needs nothing
It stands complete"
Was it you?
I don't remember
But it makes me wonder
Jonny, why couldn't you be ready, too?
I was ready, ready to be happy
Ready for that long look that never ends
And, now, I don't know what to do
Yes, Jonny, I'll say it
This is a love song, isn't it?
Yes, well, I guess this is how it ends
A strange poem about a plain and ready white wall
One with many questions
And a dog as speechless as that same wall
And the sorrows of love's slow passing
Goodbye, Jonny1Embed I Know You Lyrics[Verse]

I drove to Tennessee
Just for him to kiss me
I tried too hard
Too hard

But he never took me out
We stayed shut up in his house
I tried too hard
Too hard

He said
What's the point, dear?
What's the point, dear?
What's the point?
Yeah he said
What's the point, dear?
What's the point, dear?
What's the point?

Every song he'd sing
I'd pretend was for me
I tried too hard
Too hard

He kept me at arm's length
But close enough to play his game
I tried too hard
Too hard

He said
What's the point, dear?
What's the point, dear?
What's the point?
Yeah he said
What's the point, dear?

I don't let myself out
But I like it like that
I don't get the point of leaving my house
'Cause I always come back
Yeah‚ always come back

[Verse 3]
And I'm too scared to look
I never know what happens
So I keep rereading the same book
'Cause I know how it ends
Yeah‚ I know how it ends

And I'm loneliest at night
After my shower beer
And I'll go to sleep without turning out the lights

I miss your house on the hill
The one with your room on the right
I miss your voice, you're the only one with it
It reminds me of what used to be mine

[Verse 2]
I miss you in Chattanooga
I drive through there all the time
And I listen to you when I feel like crying
It reminds me of what used to be mine

[Verse 3]
I miss your shirt that didn't fit right
I've worn it to sleep once or twice
I try not to go where I first met you
It reminds me of what used to be mine
[Verse 4]
I only see you on occasion
Some form of you, not in real life
Right now your picture's all over Atlanta
No matter which way that I drive
It reminds me of what used to be mine
You remind me of what used to be mine3Embed Pigeon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Not sure what day it is
When I stopped counting it
My time's been wasted
Been thinking of him
I wonder if he remembers my brother's name
I only said it once but was he listening?

[Verse 2]
It's the little things
That just aren't the same
I used to make my bed
But now I see no point in it
He's awake the whole time that I'm asleep
Maybe that's why I don't see him in my dreams
[Verse 3]
Don't know what to do (Don't)
I have nothing to do (No)
There's nowhere to go (Go)
I just stay at home
I sent a pigeon with a note to his house
I hope he hung it up but probably threw it out

[Chorus]
I sent a pigeon with a note to his house
I hope he hung it up but probably threw it out
I wish I knew but I am too afraid to ask
I should just let it go but I can't not look backEmbed A Stranger LyricsToday I might just lay around
Listen to the same song
Cry for no reason at all
Get it out of my system

You know, I used to love getting bored
But now without you, I have so much time to think
There's nothing to think about anymore

I don't feel like myself right now
Feel like a stranger
Wonder, who that person might be
And if you'd still love her

And today I get upset over this song that I heard
And I guess I was just upset because why didn't I think of it first
And tell me why am I sad
When there is somewhere I don't want to go
Even though you invited me and I still said noEmbed Come to Atlanta Lyrics[Verse 1]
I want my time back, I want my time back
I want my time back with you

Why do you only speak of it?
When will you come to Atlanta?
I want to see you here in Atlanta

I don't want no one but you

I’ve been waiting for so long
Waiting for you
Maybe you’ll give up and come home
I just want you

[Verse]
All these letters that you wrote
They remind me
You’re not far when you leave home
That’s the best part

[Chorus]
Is it too much to ask you to never let me go?
Is it too much to ask you to hold me even close?
Is it too much to ask you to never let me go?
Is it too much to ask?
[Verse]
It’s the road that takes you away
That’s the worst part
'Cause once it takes you, makes you stay
There’s no way out

Is it too much to ask you to never let me go?
Is it too much to ask you to hold me even close?
Is it too much to ask you?

I remember when you were talking about flying me out
I remember how it was easy to pick me out of the crowd
But I guess I just remember when

[Verse]
I remember when you were happy just to walk me to my car
I remember every song you wrote me and how it touched my heart
But I guess I just remember when

[Verse]
I remember when you told your brother and the way it made you feel
I remember telling my brothers I think this thing is real
But I guess I just remember when

[Verse]
I remember when I would see you and the way you'd look at me
I remember way before these casual greetings on the street
But I guess I just remember when
[Outro]
I can't help but to remember when
And I wonder if you remember when2Embed Say It Now Lyrics[Verse]
It's not knowing who's about to leave
That makes it harder for you to speak
Someone told me to never let anyone go
'Cause you'll never know what you need

[Chorus]
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now

[Verse]
If you're anything like me
You'll miss the chance to say what you mean
When you're lonesome and everyone forgets that you're there
All we do is sit patiently
[Chorus]
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now

[Verse]
Well, the worst is when someone talks
In response, you say nothing at all
You're expected to solve all their pain
You just want them to back off

[Chorus]
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now

Lovers that live far apart
Need one another
But only have their postcards
I guess it doesn't work like that

[Verse]
The pitcher of the baseball team
Traded in his jersey
Doesn't want to leave
I guess it doesn't work like that
I guess it doesn't work like that

[Verse]
A collar around a dog's neck
His only identity
And he has no say in it
I guess it doesn't work like that

My sister is a hard worker
She doesn't deserve to be behind the counter
I guess it doesn't work like that
I guess it doesn't work like that

I've seen my mother in pain
Begging for her mom to remember her name
I guess it doesn't work like that
It never really works like that1Embed It’s Not a Sad Thing Lyrics[Verse]
Well I wonder what he's doing and if he's falling asleep
I wonder if the flight attendant's prettier than me
I know he's coming back, but I still didn't want him to leave
But it's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing at all

[Verse]
My dear grandmother watches birds every day
I can picture her at the window calling out their names
She's got no one else to talk to and I guess that keeps her sane
But it's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing at all
[Verse]
An overheard conversation from the table to my left
Explaining his tattoos and the ones he hasn't gotten yet
Some of them with meaning, but most of them with regret
But it's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing at all

[Outro]
No it's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing
It's never a sad thing at all2Embed Wrong People Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been told by a friend
Or at least, I wish he was
That I should go and find the best
I'm not sure what that consists

Chances are it's not gonna find me first
Gonna have to open my eyes
Discover things I don't wanna find

[Chorus]
But if you're the smartest man in the room
You're hanging with the wrong people
Yeah, you're hanging with the wrong people

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing wrong with knowin'
Way more than I should
That way, when I get the words
I'll know exactly where it hurts
Even though the comfort here feels like a home
I just can't stop right here
Still got a whole lot more years

[Chorus]
But if you're the smartest man in the room
You're hanging with the wrong people
Yeah, you're hanging with the wrong people

[Verse 3]
Maybe I took what you said just a little too far
Maybe I took it just far enough
To help me find my way up

[Chorus]
But if you're the smartest man in the room
You're hanging with the wrong people
Yeah, you're hanging with the wrong people
Yeah, you're hanging with the wrong
Hanging with the wrong people1Embed Give Me a Chance LyricsI don't know if I need this
But I want nothing else
Trouble can bring me down
He can't tell me how
I'm gonna get to you

I'm aware what is going on
What else is there to do
When you're head over heels
For something so surreal
You don't play by the rules

This is my first romance
I'm gonna love you like I told you I would
If you give me a chance
I'm gonna love you like I told you I would
If you give me a chance
Trouble made his way into this
Yeah he started what
He told me what not to do
He said don't mess with you
Or he'll never leave me

So I made a home in my heart
For trouble to stay
No matter how nice I can be
Well I asked trouble away
He turned his back on me

This is my first romance
I'm gonna love you like I told you I would
If you give me a chance
I'm gonna love you like I told you I would
If you give me a chance

I've let him stay with me for way too long
Now I'm trouble myself
But if you liked me then
And you're ready to give in
You're gonna love me now
You're gonna love me now
Yeah you're gonna love me nowEmbed I Know I’ll Find You One Day Lyrics[Verse]
I want to tell you to put your weapon down
But you might lock the door and shut me out
I guess your sadness was the kind that couldn't wait
It took more courage for you to live than just to get away

[Chorus]
I'm done with the pain
I've gone mad and I've been insane
I'm just gonna miss you
I'm just gonna miss you
I'm just gonna miss you

[Verse]
I know you missed your dad, I'd miss mine too
We all find different forms for something we lose
Just wish you'd stay around for one more year
So you could find what he's left behind for you here
[Chorus]
I'm done with the pain
I've gone mad and I've been insane
I'm just gonna miss you
I'm just gonna miss you
I'm just gonna miss you

[Verse]
If you see me and I'm still searching in the crowds
Just know that I'm looking for you even thought you're not around
It's times like these when no matter what they say
I tell my mind you're out there

[Outro]
I know I'll find you one day
I know I'll find you one day
I know I'll find you one day
I know I'll find you one dayEmbed Mama Stay LyricsMama I'm not sure if you have caught on
But I want you to
I might like you more than yourself
I can't help
I just do
And everything you've got you deserve
And you're earned along the way
That woman who treats you well
I can tell by the look on your face
On your face

You look happy just the way you are
I think you know this
You play a big part
On who I want to be like
When it's my time to choose
I want to be like you
I may think of you a lot more than this girl is willing to admit
But my thoughts will always be the same
They don't change one bit
And the words that are scribbled in your skin
They've been a favorite of mine
I finally found someone I know I want to grow up like
Grow up like

You look happy just the way you are
I think you know this
You play a big part
On who I want to be like
When it's my time to choose
I want to be like you

Don't have to try
I'll be by your side
And if I'm not
I'll be on my way
You're in a really good place
So mama stay

You look happy just the way you are
I think you know this
You play a big part
On who I want to be like
When it's my time
You look happy just the way you are
I think you know this
You play a big part
On who I want to be like
When it's my time to choose
I want to be like you
I want to be like youEmbed Sweet Lad Lyrics[Verse]
Did he make the right move?
What would a man do?
Yeah he held back
And I tried to fix that
I'm in no hurry
Oh but he does not worry
'Cause time is your friend
I'm losing him again

[Chorus]
I miss you, sweet lad
I miss you, sweet lad
Miss me too
Yeah I want you, sweet lad
I want you, sweet lad
Want me too
[Bridge]
Nothing could ever go wrong
When I leave I'll take you along
I miss you sweet lad
Do you miss me too?

[Verse]
When I am lonely
I wish for him only
I want his soft touch
When I miss him too much
He is on his way
To a better place
I'm stuck here behind
I've done nothing in my life

I miss you, sweet lad
I miss you, sweet lad
Miss me too

Nothing could ever go wrong
When I leave I'll take you along
I miss you, sweet lad
Do you miss me too?Embed Dancing in the Dark Lyrics[Verse]
I get up in the evening
I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
But hey there baby, I could use just a little help

[Chorus]
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun is for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[Verse]
Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I want to change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is
[Chorus]
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun is for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[Bridge]
You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, this laugh's on me

[Verse]
Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, gimme just one look

[Outro]
You can't start a fire
Sitting round crying over a broken heart
This gun is for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun is for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the darkEmbed Sadness in the Air LyricsWhen you see something that you love a lot
Crash and burn into sand
You wanna pick it up
You wanna take it home
But you can't cuz it falls through your hands
Can you see sadness in the air?
Can you believe it's coming after me?

And when you see rain
Do you think of tears?
God is crying, someone told me
And my teardrops are about the same size
And each one tells it's own story
Can you see sadness in the air?
Can you believe it's coming after me?
I think I've been doing too much losing
I'm afraid what's going next
I hope that I live a life of the best

When you see a light shining through your glass
Do you feel hope?
Do you think it's a sign?
You watch it disappear below the grass
It was just the sun coming in through the blinds
Can you see sadness in the air?
Can you believe it's coming after me?

I think I've been doing too much losing
I'm afraid what's going next
I hope that I live a life of the best

And now you can see
What pain has brought to me
Brought to me

I think I've been doing too much losing
I am afraid what's going next
I hope that I live a life of the best
I hope that I live the life of the bestEmbed Picture in My Mind LyricsI can name the people that I want to meet
But I'm afraid it'll change what I think
If I could meet someone new
I'd probably choose someone I don't know too much about

That way I don't lose my hope
Of anything I think I know

I
I got this picture in my mind
This perfect figure
And I might be wrong
I don't want to know
I don't let my mind roam

I may hear their name almost every day
I could hear the goods people say
I still won't let myself give in
I know all I need to
That's gonna be it
That way I don't lose my hope
Of anything I think I know

I
I got this picture in my mind
This perfect figure
And I might be wrong
I don't want to know
I don't let my mind roam

Hold on
How long
You lost me there
What are you saying?
The words I heard just made me scared
My mind's changing

I
I got this picture in my mind
Of this perfect figure
And I might be wrong
I don't want to know
I don't let my mind
I got this picture in my mind
Of this perfect figure
And I might be wrong
I don't want to know
I don't let my mind roamEmbed So Well Known Lyrics[Verse 1]
You might meet a girl from a place you never heard
She knows you but you never met her
You're so well known
People know you from the songs you sing
You're a big-shot guy
Nobody will be as good as you

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody said this would be easy
Easy comes or harder goes

[Chorus]
Well, it's hard not to go on in this world
I bet you're the only one, that's for sure
Gonna make it no matter what for
[Verse 2]
So who do you find yourself looking at?
If you don't find something, you'll go back to where you were
You can look down, but you can't look up
'Cause the spot you're in makes learning tough
That's what you're for

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody said this would be easy
Easy comes or harder goes

[Chorus]
Well, it's hard not to go on in this world
I bet you're the only one, that's for sure
Gonna make it no matter what for

[Outro]
Come time
Come time
No one knows what's coming for you
Just might
Just might
Find something else to do
So hope that nothing goes wrong

Do people wonder why you chose to go?
Do you miss your home or anything back where you're from?
Do you try and tell them all the same thing?
You don't wanna leave 'cause it's all to see how far you've comeEmbed Run and Tell Lyrics[Verse]
This ain't what I thought and I don't know what to think
I've lost my mind for the second time letting go of dreams

[Verse]
Feels like I've gone insane making sense of what I see
It just don't look like those picture books they read to me

[Chorus]
Run and tell my father
Run and tell my father
Run and tell him I'm giving up

[Verse]
It's a part of getting old and I'm halfway there
Just one more step and I'll regret how much I care
[Verse]
Maybe it's a sign that I'm no longer a kid
'Cause I have seen almost everything life has to give

[Chorus]
Run and tell my father
Run and tell my father
Run and tell him I'm giving up

[Verse]
Guess this is just some dream that I've been making up
I feel bad for me 'cause I thought I'd be deep in love

[Chorus]
Run and tell my father
Run and tell my father
Run and tell him I'm giving upEmbed Car Therapy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every Tuesday
I'll be in the driveway
Talking to a stranger for some help
Yes, you guessed it
Flowers made of plastic
'Cause I can barely take care of myself

[Verse 2]
Cold showers
You always forget your towel
I got you one before you even moved in
Hold my body
And I'll forget I hate me
You hate when I say that but I did
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Every Tuesday
I'll be in the driveway
Talking to a stranger for some help
Yes, you guessed it
Flowers made of plastic
'Cause I can barely take care of myselfEmbed Lonestar LyricsI wish
I wish I was back down south with my cousins
I got a few
There wasn't much to do around
You knew every face in town
Yes you do

Oh well I
I think you know by now
I love that place
I know it sounds a little crazy but maybe
That Lone Star State could be the perfect place for me

I buy a new pack of picks every day
Or guitar strings
They would break
They'd break for sure
Whatever it was I played something new
Every town we were in tune
Yes we were
Oh and I
I think you know by now
I love that place
I know it sounds a little crazy but maybe
That Lone Star State could be the perfect place for me

Run away
Run away
I could do it
Every day
Every day
But I knew it would not be
Good for me

Oh I
I think you know by now
I love that place
I know it sounds a little crazy but maybe
That Lone Star State could be the perfect place for
I
I think you know by now
I love that place
I know it sounds a little crazy but maybe
That Lone Star State could be the perfect place for meEmbed Give Me a Chance (Reprise) LyricsTrouble's already been with me
Growing up so young
I guess it's time
To put him aside
And make you mine

Ooh give me a chance
Ooh give me a chance
Ooh give me a chance
Ooh give me a chance

Ooh give me a chance
Ooh give me a chance
Ooh give me a chance
Ooh give me a chanceEmbed Dancing With the Angels LyricsMemories surround me
But sadness has found me
I'd do anything for more time
Never before has someone meant more
And I can't get you out of my mind

There is so much that I don't understand
But I know

[Chorus]
You're dancing with the angels
Walking in new life
You're dancing with the angels
Heaven fills your eyes
Now that you're dancing with the angels
You had love for your family
Love for all people
Love for the Father, and Son
Your heart will be heard
In your unspoken words
Through generations to come

There is so much that I don't understand
But I know

[Chorus]
You're dancing with the angels
Walking in new life
You're dancing with the angels
Heaven fills your eyes
Now that you're dancing with the angels

[Bridge]
We're only here for such a short time
So I'm gonna' stand up, shout out
And sing Hallelujah
One day I'll see you again

[Chorus]
You're dancing with the angels
Walking in new life
You're dancing with the angels
Heaven fills your eyes
Now that you're dancing with the angelsEmbed If You Need To, Keep Time on Me - Recorded At Electric Lady Studios Lyrics[Verse 1]

I'm here in New York City at Electric Lady Studios with my band
We're gonna play some songs
Thanks for listening

You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way

You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way

You came here to welcome me
To what is the end

We’d still be best friends
We both tell the same jokes
Over and over
Wonder if we'll get married
Before my brother

[Chorus]
And let's cheers to you
And let’s cheers to me

[Verse 2]
I like your songs even though
They're not about me
Sometimes I'm scared to show my dad

And let's cheers to you
And let’s cheers to meEmbed I Know I’m Funny haha - Recorded At Electric Lady Studios Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let's sit around and drink some saké
Then we can argue 'bout the same things
Talk about neighbors on our front porch
I wonder if they know we're moving
Hope they don't know my landlord personally
'Cause I never told him you moved in with me
But fuck him, he kept my money

[Verse 2]
I think your sisters are so pretty
Got drunk and they forgot they met me
I made her laugh one time at dinner
She said I'm funny and then I thanked her
But I know I'm funny haha

We go through phases when we're over ours
Right now we both wanna be rockstars
Got you a bass last year on your birthday
The same one the guy from Linkin Park plays
But you look better with it anywaysEmbed Kind Of - Recorded At Electric Lady Studios Lyrics[Verse 1]
Who loved you first?
Who loved you last?
Why do I even think of these things?
'Cause I've always been the type to see all the bad before all the good things
Haven't written the song in a minute
Haven't been in love in forever
But I'm looking at you, you're looking at me at every single possible angle

And it's not like how you make me feel
I don't feel this kind of type of way
And it's not like how you make me feel

I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way

Sit around until I find something better to spend my time
But nothing's appealin'
Nothing really lasts that long for me to realize, I'm still alone
And you're not with me
I wonder what's inside your mind, but you seem pretty occupied
So I'll leave it alone
If only I could do the same, share your ways, and I'll change the name
And make it my own

[Chorus]
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
[Verse 2]
I tried to eat, I tried to sleep, but everything seems boring to me
I don't know what to do
Got two friends that I could see, but they got two jobs and a baby
I just wanna see you
Dependin' on our time apart, thе better the distractions arе
And there isn't a lot
Only took a couple times without you here to realize
But I figured it out

[Chorus]
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?Embed Kingston - Recorded At Electric Lady Studios Lyrics[Verse 1]
The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time
I don't know that much about Kingston
But I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain
I think that tonight I'll leave my light on
'Cause I get lonely when it's out and I miss you right about now

[Chorus]
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more

[Verse 2]
He said baby, that's what he called me, I love you
Every single word you say makes me feel some typе of way
It's the thought of you that slightly scares me
But it takеs my breath away, forget what I was gonna say
The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time
[Chorus]
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
